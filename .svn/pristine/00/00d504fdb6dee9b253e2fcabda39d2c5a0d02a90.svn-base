- allow customization (prolog, etc) in DIDL XML serialization.

- allow (de)serialization any DIDL element.

- validation of DIDL.

- ability to create didl elements from any DIDLBaseType not just DIDL's

- get access to the DIDLRegistry and change its behaviour

- addItem(didl.newItem()) can be directly supported by addItem() 

- Should the InnerClass info.repo.didl.impl.AbstractAttributes.Entry still be there, or can we remove it?

- I also notice an issue with AttributeType, this is demonstrated by running:
 Counter ex/didl03.xml
 In didl03.xml we have an unknown namespace "http://foo.org", in
  this case I think we need a fallback class (simialr to ByteArray) to
 process attributes from unknown namespaces instead of throwing an
 exception.

- Did you see this section from the JAR specification?
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jar/jar.html#Service%20Provider

This could become handy when shipping registries of DIDL(de)serializes.
